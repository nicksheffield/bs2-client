TODO
	figure out a way to serve the correct page when you're running a built version of the app.
		The reason is, using webpack dev server gives you the history api fallback.
		I wonder if a microframework is a good choice for this, or maybe just go with a 
		custom little php solution.
	auth
		Add auth stuff to the resolvers I guess, or maybe just $transition
	images
		Work out a way to get images loaded properly in the built version
	sweetalert2
		Make sure since I rolled my own angular wrapper, that I don't just fuckin leave it like
		it is, and remove that ng-sweetalert-2 bullshit
	Add sentry
		https://sentry.io/for/angular/
	Make a Generator
		So that I don't have to keep copying and pasting existing files
